OVERVIEW :

Project Overview :

The Bluetooth-Controlled Home Automation System is designed to remotely control multiple electrical devices using an Android smartphone or similar Bluetooth-enabled device. The system allows users to toggle devices on or off via Bluetooth commands using an HC-05 Bluetooth module. Additionally, manual control of devices is provided using push buttons for redundancy or when Bluetooth is not active. The status of each device is displayed on a 16x2 LCD, ensuring real-time feedback for the user.


COMPONENTS REQUIRED :

1)Microcontroller: Arduino Nano (or equivalent).

2)Bluetooth Module: HC-05 for wireless communication.

3)4-Channel Relay Module: To control high-power electrical devices.

4)Push Buttons: 4 buttons for manual control.

5)Resistors: 4 x 10kÎ© for pull-up configuration with push buttons.

6)16x2 LCD Display: For displaying the device states.

7)LED Indicators: For visual confirmation of relay states (optional).

8)Connecting Wires: For establishing connections.

9)Power Supply: 5V DC power source for the circuit.


USES AND APPLICATIONS : 

-Home Automation: Automates appliances like lights, fans, and other devices, enabling control via Bluetooth.

-Remote Device Control: Allows users to control devices from a distance using a smartphone.

-Energy Management: Helps reduce energy consumption by allowing precise control of devices.

-Accessibility Solutions: Useful for people with limited mobility to control devices wirelessly.

-Manual and Automated Control: Provides redundancy with manual buttons, ensuring usability even without Bluetooth.

-Educational Project: Demonstrates Bluetooth communication, relay control, and LCD interfacing in embedded systems.

-Scalable Systems: Can be extended to control more devices or integrated with IoT platforms for internet-based control.
